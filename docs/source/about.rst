**Multi-CCD Point Spread Function Modelling.**


The non-parametric MCCD PSF modelling, or MCCD for short, is a Point Spread Function modelling
pure python package.  
It is used to generate a PSF model based on stars observations in the field of view.
Once trained, the MCCD PSF model can then recover the PSF at any position in the field of view.
It has been tested on real data from the UNIONS/CFIS data with weak lensing purposes.

  There is also a module with useful functions to simulate exposures.
